title: Ultimate AI battle - Apple vs. Google
---

Yesterday, Apple launched its Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) and had its public keynote address. While many new things were announced, the one thing that caught my eye was the [dramatic expansion](http://go.theinformation.com/HnOAdA6DQ7g) of Apple's use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. I talked a bit about AI with Hilary Parker on the latest [*Not So Standard Deviations*](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/06/09/nssd-episode-17/), particularly in the context of Amazon's Echo/Alexa, and I think it's definitely going to be an area of intense competition between the major tech companies.

* Description at a high level because I am not an expert in AI, Deep Learning, etc.
* Fusion science: Big Data = Prior, Small Data = Likelihood
* Thin client, Big Server vs. Fat Client, Big Server
* Examples:
	* Updating the mean one observation at a time (prior/posterior)
	* Updating a linear model one observation at a time.
