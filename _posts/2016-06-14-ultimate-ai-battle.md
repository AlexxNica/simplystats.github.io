title: Ultimate AI battle: Apple vs. Google
---

Yesterday, Apple launched its Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) and had its public keynote address. While many new things were announced, the one thing that caught my eye was the [dramatic expansion](https://www.theinformation.com/apples-machines-can-learn-too?token=XJkQCo16vBfc_Eo4cZ0swg) of Apple's use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. I talked a bit about AI with Hilary Parker on the latest [*Not So Standard Deviations*](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-17-diurnal-high-variance), particularly in the context of Amazon's Echo/Alexa, and I think it's definitely going to be an area of intense competition between the major tech companies.
