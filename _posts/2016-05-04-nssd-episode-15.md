This is Hilary's and my last New York-Baltimore episode! In future
episodes, Hilary will be broadcasting from California. In this episode
we discuss collaboration tools and workflow management for data
science projects. To date, I have not found a project management tool
that I can actually use (besides email), but am open to suggestions
(from students).
