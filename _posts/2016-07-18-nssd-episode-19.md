title: Not So Standard Deviations Episode 18 - Divide by n-1, or n-2, or Whatever
---

Hilary and I talk about statistical software in fMRI analyses, the differences between software testing differences in proportions (a must listen!), and a preview of JSM 2016. 

Also, Hilary and I have just published a new book, [Conversations on Data Science](https://leanpub.com/conversationsondatascience?utm_source=SimplyStats&utm_campaign=NSSD&utm_medium=BlogPost), which collects some of our episodes in an easy-to-read format. The books is available from Leanpub and will be updated as we record more episodes.
