A few days ago I posted a little web app called [papr](jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/papr) I built using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). It was meant to mimic the functionality of the dating app Tindr, but for preprints. Basically you make a snap judgement on the accuracy and the interestingness of papers from [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/). It was later improved on by Lucy and Nate to allow real swiping functionaliy. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dtoken = "~/Dropbox/Jeff/code/github/2016/papr/papr-drop.rds"
files = 
```

```{r}

```
